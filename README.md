# [@me_irl_bot_two](https://instagram.com/me_irl_bot_two)

[@me_irl_bot_two](https://instagram.com/me_irl_bot_two) is a modified version of a project I started early 2019 which later turned into an [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/me_irl_bot_two) with over 11.4k followers at its [peak](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylastrog/me_irl_bot_two/master/peak_screenshot.png) before it got shut down.

## Update!

> The bot has been turned back on as of August 6th, 2020!


The bot grabs a post found on [/r/me_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl] and then uploads to Instagram with a comment that follows which contains proper credit.

The bot is an attempt at recreating another bot which did the same thing, created by [@freekbes](https://freekb.es/).

Made in Visual Studio and coded with C#.

# Packages

The bot uses two packages to function: [InstagramAPISharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp) (considered [InstaSharper](https://github.com/InstaSharp/InstaSharp)) and [RedditSharp](https://github.com/CrustyJew/RedditSharp).
