[@me_irl_bot_two](https://instagram.com/me_irl_bot_two) was a modified version of a project I started early 2019 which later turned into an [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/me_irl_bot_two) with over 11.6k followers at its [peak](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylastrog/me_irl_bot_two/master/peak_screenshot.png)(image shows 11.4k) before it got shut down.

> UPDATE: The bot has been turned back on as of August 6th, 2020!

> UPDATE: The bot has been disabled again as of March 20th, 2021!

The bot grabbed a post found on [/r/me_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl) and then uploaded it to Instagram with a comment that followed containing proper credit.

The bot was an attempt at recreating another bot which did the same thing, created by [@freekbes](https://freekb.es/). His bot was previously banned so I took it upon myself to recreate it.

> UPDATE: As of March 20th, 2021, [@freekbes](https://freekb.es/) created a new bot for the subreddit [/r/196](https://www.reddit.com/r/196) but later changed it to [/r/me_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl) due to the fact that [/r/196](https://www.reddit.com/r/196) had too much NSFW content.

Made in Visual Studio and coded with C#.

# Packages

The bot uses two packages to function: [InstagramAPISharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp) (considered [InstaSharper](https://github.com/InstaSharp/InstaSharp)) and [RedditSharp](https://github.com/CrustyJew/RedditSharp).
