@me_irl_bot_two was a modified version of a project I started early 2019 which later turned into an [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/me_irl_bot_two) with over 11.4k followers at its [peak](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylastrog/me_irl_bot_two/master/peak_screenshot.png)!

The bot would grab a post found on [/r/me_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl] and then uploaded to Instagram with a comment containing proper credit which followed.

This was an attempt at recreating another bot that did the same thing, which was created by [@freekbes](https://freekb.es/).

# Packages

The bot used two packages to function: [InstagramAPISharp](https://github.com/ramtinak/InstagramApiSharp) (considered [InstaSharper](https://github.com/InstaSharp/InstaSharp)) and [RedditSharp](https://github.com/CrustyJew/RedditSharp).
