@me_irl_bot_two was a modified version of a project I started early 2019 which later turned into an [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/me_irl_bot_two) with over 11.5k followers at its peak!

The bot would grab a post found on [/r/me_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl] and then uploaded to Instagram with a comment that followed with proper credit.

This was an attempt at recreating another bot that did the same thing, which was created by [@freekbes](https://freekb.es/).
